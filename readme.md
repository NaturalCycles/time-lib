# Why

- Fixes TypeScript imports, regardless if esModuleInterop is used or not
- ~~Allows to use it as ESM package with tree-shaking (without breaking your TypeScript again)~~
- Opinionated. Includes "needed" dayjs plugins by default.
- Allows to "just import dayjs" and not worry about:
  - Loading plugins for all of your "entry points", such as `startServer.ts`, `setupJest.ts`, at
    every cron job, etc.
  - That plugins are loaded BEFORE they are used (dependent on import order)
  - That TypeScript types are not loaded with plugins
- Extends dayjs with some useful functions (via Plugin interface)
- Has working `isoWeekday` plugin
- Has `en-gb` locale by default, so, default firstDayOfWeek is Monday
